# Task

Develop a backend server with ExpressJS. You are required to build a set of CRUD interface that allow a user to interact with the service. You are required to use TypeScript for this task.

1. Interface functionalities:
    1. Create a resource.
    2. List resources with basic filters.
    3. Get details of a resource.
    4. Update resource details.
    5. Delete a resource.
2. You should connect your backend service with a simple database for data persistence.

# Solution

With expressJS I have multiple options to create a server. And I have chosen NestJS because it is a framework that allows me to create a server with a structure that is easy to maintain and scale. It also allows me to use TypeScript and it is easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks.
